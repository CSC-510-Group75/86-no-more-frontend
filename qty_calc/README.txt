Add jars in libs folder to classpath if you're using an IDE!!

Each .java file should have a main method if you want to manually test. Manual testing should be done through an IDE for sanity's sake.






----------------------------------------------

file name: recipe_[RECIPE_ID].txt
Replace [RECIPE_ID] with the recipe's ID as recorded in the database.
Contents of each file:

recipe_name
recipe_id
[ingredient]

ex)
recipe_0002.txt

Contents:
mystery blob
0002
[cheese, 5534, 8, lbs]
[rice, 7881, 2, cups dry]
[ingr3, db_id, local_qty, local_unit]
...
[ingrN, db_id, local_qty, local_unit]

One ingredient per line.

NOTE: these are for TESTING.
